# Basic settings for SUDO.
# No arguments required


# If we don't do this, sudo will reset the PATH and it won't correctly
# find emacs or some of the locally installed stuff.  Use \$PATH in this
# so the $PATH doesn't get processed until the sudo alias is actually
# invoked rather than being replaced here immediately
alias sudo="sudo PATH=\$PATH "

# we're using this in our sudo alias to make sure we don't try opening a client to our daemon when sudoing
export SUDOEDITOR="emacs"
